With an M.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Notre Dame and a B.S. in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Nepal Engineering College, I bring hands-on experience as both a Data Analyst and a Software Engineer. My graduate work deepened my expertise in data science, neural networks, and research methodology, fueling my drive to solve real problems with data.

Iâ€™m excited to pursue a full-time role where I can apply these skills to deliver measurable business value.
